# FileRenamer
A little Program which is able to rename all files in a given directory.

There are **two ways** to execute the program:
- Clone the Repository and run the `fileRenamer.py` file via python
- Download the `fileRenamer.exe` file and run it via the console

The Syntax is easy and to see further commands just call the programm with the `'-h' parameter`.
